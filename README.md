# KotlinWeather
Simple app that fetches the weather that I used to teach myself Kotlin.  If I were to do this again there are a few things that I would change now that I better understand Kotlin.  In order to be able to build this you will need to obtain an api key for this api https://openweathermap.org/forecast16 and add it as a resourse.  You will also need to insert your own url as a resource.  You can use this as a template http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?zip=%d,us&amp;units=imperial&amp;cnt=16&amp;APPID=%s.
